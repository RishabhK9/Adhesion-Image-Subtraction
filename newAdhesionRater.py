# Bryant's Description:
# Classifies a single adhesion tape test image (after converting it to binary black and white) as per ASTM D3359.
# Takes a single baseline image and converts it to black and white
# The image should be an image that is known to be of class 5 (no flaking).
# Then take a different image of unknown class and classify it.

# Bryant's To-Do List:
# Properly crop all input images (hopefully automatically) so that they are all the same size or aspect ratio.
# Dylan's Note: We still need to add the functionality of automatically cropping photos to then classify

# Develop code so that this works properly
# Utilize a better method of making images black and white.
# Alternatively, think of a better way to do all of this.
